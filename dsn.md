# Darthion Safety Network (DSN)


Darthion Safety Network (DSN) is a unique initiative to reduce the risk of ongoing smart contract hacks in the decentralized application community. The bad actors keep getting better and better to find ways to hack the smart contracts in the scenario which was very uncommon by the developers. So, to reduce this risk and to protect the digital assets of the Darthion users, DSN was created. 

DSN encourages smart contract security experts/auditors to review the smart contracts code published in the platform. And DSN will reward those auditors who find security and/or logical vulnerabilities based on their severity. 

DSN will report those issues to smart contract creators privately to make sure to take mitigation steps and will help to get through this process. This will be a paid service for smart contract creators if they need any further extensive help secure their smart contracts.

DSN encourages all the smart contract security experts/auditors to be part of the DSN to help secure the infrastructure and at the same time receive generous rewards in doing so.
